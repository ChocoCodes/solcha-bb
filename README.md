- üì∞ Community-Driven Emergency Bulletins

### Features
- **Community Bulletin**: A real-time, crowd-sourced update board where users can share on-the-ground information with varying tags and remarks to strengthen community awareness and response.
- **RAG-Assisted Chatbot**: A conversational assistant powered by Google Gemini that provides easy-to-understand answers to questions about volcanic activity, safety procedures, and preparedness in real time. Real-time data about the status of the Kanlaon Volcano is extracted through DOST-PHIVOLCS bulletin and database.
- **Interactive Safety Map**: A geolocation-based tool using Maps Javascript and Places API that helps users identify nearby evacuation centers and safe zones outside of the 6km Permanent Danger Zone radius, enhancing decision-making during volcanic emergencies.

### Acknowledgement
The data used for monitoring and analyzing the status of Kanlaon Volcano was sourced from the following:

- **National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC)**  
  Situation Reports (SitReps) from the most recent eruption were retrieved in PDF format and processed as part of this system's data repository.

- **Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (DOST-PHIVOLCS)**  
  Real-time volcanic data was obtained through automated web scraping from the official PHIVOLCS website, with data extraction scheduled daily at 12:00 PM.

We acknowledge the efforts of these institutions in providing timely and reliable volcanic activity data to support disaster preparedness and public awareness.

### Data Policy
This AI-powered chatbot does **NOT** predict, forecast, or issue warnings regarding volcanic activity. Instead, it serves as an **informational assistant**‚Äîusing publicly available data to help users better understand the current status of Kanlaon Volcano.

The primary role of this chatbot is to **enhance public awareness and understanding** by providing simplified, structured, and contextual explanations of official data. By doing so, it aims to empower individuals with knowledge that can support **informed decision-making and preparedness** in the event of a volcanic emergency.

#### Use of DOST-PHIVOLCS Data

This system integrates data labeled as "public" from the **Department of Science and Technology ‚Äì Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (DOST-PHIVOLCS)** in accordance with the following guidelines:

- Users of DOST-PHIVOLCS data must register with a valid email address and password. Registration is required only once.
- The data source must always be properly cited as: **DOST-PHIVOLCS**.
- Only **DOST-PHIVOLCS officials** are authorized to use the data for **public forecasting** of ongoing volcanic unrest in the Philippines.
- Redistribution or monetization of DOST-PHIVOLCS data is prohibited.

We fully respect and follow these policies, ensuring that this chatbot remains a **support tool for education and disaster preparedness**, not a substitute for official alerts or scientific authority.
